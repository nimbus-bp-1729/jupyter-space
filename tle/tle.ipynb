This  number  usually  refers  to atmospheric drag on a satellite. However, at times satellites are strongly affected by the gravitational pull of bodies other than the Earth (ie: Sun and Moon).  While it  seems  unlikely,  drag  can  actually  be  a negative number thus indicating an increase in orbital energy rather than a decrease. This happens when  the  Sun  and Moon  combine  to  pull the satellite's apogee to a higher altitude.  However, this condition of negative drag is only valid for as long as the gravitational situation warrants  it.  So,  some  folks like to zero out negative drag factors for smoother orbital calculations.\n",

    "09-16  Inclination (in degrees), i.e., the angle formed by the orbit to the  equator.  The inclination must be a positive number of degrees between 0 and 180. A zero angle of inclination indicates a satellite moving  from  west  to  east  directly  over  the equator.  An  inclination of 28 degrees (most shuttle launches) would form an angle of 28 degrees between the equator and  the  orbit  of  the  satellite.  Also,  that satellite  will  travel  only  as far north and south as +- 28 degrees latitude. On it's ascending orbital crossing (moving from south to north) of  the  equator,  the satellite  will be moving from southwest to northeast. An inclination of 90 degrees would mean that the satellite is moving directly from south to north and will cross directly  over the north and south poles. Any satellite with an inclination greater than 90 degrees is said to be in retrograde orbit.  This  means  the  satellite  is  moving  in  a  direction  opposite  the  rotation of the earth. A satellite with an inclination of 152 degrees will be moving from southeast to northwest as  it  cross the  equator  from south to north. This is opposite the rotation of the Earth. This satellite will move as far north and south of the equator as  28  degrees  latitude  and  be in an orbital direction exactly opposite a satellite with an inclination of 28 degrees.\n",

    "18-25  Right ascension of ascending node (RAAN or RA  of  Node).   In  order  to  fix  the position  of  an  orbit  in  space  it is necessary to refer to a coordinate system outside the earth  coordinate  system.  Because  the  Earth  rotates  latitude  and longitude  coordinates do not indicate an absolute frame of reference. Therefore it was decided to use astronomical conventions to fix orbits relative to the celestial sphere  which  is  delineated  in degrees of Right Ascension and declination. Right ascension is similar to longitude and Declination is similar to latitude.  When  an element  set  is  taken  Right  Ascension  of the ascending Node is computed in the following manner. As a satellite moves about the center of the earth it crosses the equator  twice.  It  is  either  in  ascending  node, moving from south to north or descending node moving from north to south. The RAAN is taken  from  the  point  at which  the  orbit  crosses  the  equator moving from south to north. If you were to\n",

    "       The  center  of  the  ellipse  is  at  one  of  the  two  foci of the ellipse.  The\n",
